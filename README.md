# Sentiment Analysis 
 
The Sentiment Analysis for Enhanced Well-being project employed NLP techniques and chi-square modeling to explore the emotional states of user responses, both in text and speech. Using VADER sentiment analysis and webkitSpeechRecognition(), the study revealed links between user sentiment and factors such as time management, sleep habits, and physical activity. These insights enhance our understanding of emotional well-being and support the development of personalized recommendations for mental health, contributing to Sustainable Development Goal 3.
